GUI THINGS:
- Show what rocket is available to shoot at the moment
- Show to cooldown of the rocket
- Show the amount of time you will have your rocket

Camera:
- Fix pausing when room is bigger than camera
- Camara shake when someone dies? (Might be an issue as camera is the same size as room

Things to do:
- Upgrades system, damage, speed, rockets, cooldowns, etc
- Gamemode manager for 1v1 mode (requires the upgrade system)
- Higher resolution?

Future things to think about:
- Full tileset compatability
- Ability to add sound effects and background music (music engine)
