First, head on over to "pGMM" under the "Triggers.GamemodeManagers" group

#1) Create a new object and make "pGMM" as its parent
#2) Create a new room, and in its own Object category, put that GamemodeManager in the room
#3) Make sure this object activates before any other oPlayer objects
#4) Do NOT make it persistent!
#5) Go crazy with the Custom events, the step event is where you will want to inherit the parent event and use your own code!

---Other Details---
- Make sure if creating a new win condition to overwrite the default condition
- There does NOT have to be a winner!
- Please look under the default parent code, theres a ton of events for when a player dies, when the timer end and so on!
