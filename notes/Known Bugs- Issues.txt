--Bugs--
CURRENT:
- Ult casting seems to freeze if picking up a rocket while casting an ult.
- When "Teched" the player might teleport to the other side of a platform when doing so at the edge of one.

FIXED:
- Second player sometimes takes double damage from default rocket?
- Smoke particles for "Burn Rush" appears in front of player, as well as explosion
- Playing a game of knockout and returning to the menu to play a game of 1v1 results in a crash.
