---BLUEPRINT---
	case BUFFTYPE.<VALUE>:
		ds_map[? BUFF_MAP.NAME] = "NAME";
		ds_map[? BUFF_MAP.DESCRIPTION] = "DESCRIPTION";
		ds_map[? BUFF_MAP.ICON] = BUFF_ICON.<VALUE>;
		ds_map[? BUFF_MAP.STEP] = <SCRIPT>;
		break;
		
---Other Details---
- Each buff MUST keep track of its own time!
- Each buff MUST emit its own particles!
- Each buff MUST remove its own buffs/debuffs to the player once the timer has reached its clock time
- Theres a bunch of enum values you can set to a buff so you dont have to define the value in the buffs step event
