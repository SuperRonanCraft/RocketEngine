Head on over to "scRockets" under the "Rockets" group

#1) Add a new Rocket to the enum before "LENGHT" (i know its misspelled)
#2) Add the icon under "ROCKET_SPRITE"
#3) Under the last rocket, set 'roc' equal to your new ROCKET enum value
#4) Define a new ds_map to the "weapons" array with the "roc" index.
#4) Add to that weapons array, atleast a 'ROCKET_MAP' "NAME", "DESCRIPTION" and "TYPE"!
#5) If adding custom scripts, add the scripts under the "Rockets.Specials" group, and create a new group named after your rocket!

---BLUEPRINT---
	var roc = ROCKET.<VALUE>;
	weapons[roc] = ds_map_create();
	ds_map_add(weapons[roc], ROCKET_MAP.TYPE, roc);
	ds_map_add(weapons[roc], ROCKET_MAP.NAME, "NAME");
	ds_map_add(weapons[roc], ROCKET_MAP.DESCRIPTION, "DESCRIPTION");

---Available event scripts---

For Rockets:
- Create, Step and Draw
For Rocket Collisions:
- With another Rocket, a Wall or a Shootable (player) - (Overwrites default explosions)
For Explosions:
- Create and Step event - (Never called if custom rocket collision event)

---Other Details---
- Damage_Explosion and Damage_Rocket will overwrite default damage, but if default damage is -1 it will not do damage!
- If setting a Rockets Explosion create event, you must push the "rocket_map" ds_map to the explosion with "ds_map_copy", and do your own particles!
- If setting a Rockets Step event, it will NOT move! You must set the movement for that rocket!
