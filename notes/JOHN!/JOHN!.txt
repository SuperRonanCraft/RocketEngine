What i've worked on:
- Pause menu, no bugs as of yet (could use an outro animation)
- Added gamemode managers for each gamemode type
- vTarget gameplay is done, just need to add a timer and some gui changes.
- Completely new User Interface, allowing for rebinds, volume rockers, and scripts

Bugs/Not Implemented:
- UI not allowing mouse input
- Variables are stored locally for volume, fullscreen and resolution
