Head on over to "scAchievementGetType" in the "DataCollection.Achievements" group

#1) Here add to the enum "ACHIEVEMENTS" for your achievements that are custom, they can still be presented here
#2) Achievements must have a "SECTION", "TRACKING" switch statement.
#3) If the achievement needs to be checked every now and then, just add a "GOAL" so its checked automatically
#4) Custom achievement? Make a script to check it when neccessary, or when a game ends add it to "scAchievements_GameEnd"
	and add a condition for it there.

---BLUEPRINT--- (CREATING THE STAT)
	case STATISTICS_TYPE.SECTION_GENERAL:
		switch (enu) {
			case STATISTICS_GENERAL.<STATISTIC>: val = "<UNIQUE VALUE>"; break;
			
---BLUEPRINT--- (TRACKING THE STAT)
	scStatsCacheAddGeneral(STATISTICS_GENERAL.<STATISTIC>, <AMOUNT>);
	
---BLUEPRINT--- (SET THE STAT)
	var stat = STATISTICS_GENERAL.<STATISTIC>; //This value can also be replaced for an array
	var amt = <AMOUNT TO SET>; //If above is an array, this must also be an array of values (can produce error if incorrect format)
	scStatsCache(STATISTICS_TYPE.VALUE_GENERAL, [stat], [amt]);
		
---Other Details---
- Stats will not be tracked if game is closed abruptly!
- Stats can be called and set and added to from anywhere!
