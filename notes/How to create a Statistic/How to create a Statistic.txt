Head on over to "scStatsGetType" in the "DataCollection.Stats" group

#1) Here add to the enum "STATISTICS_GENERAL" for your stat (STATISTICS_GAMEMODE) are for
		specific gamemode, but they can also be set here.
#2) Statistics must have a switch statement "SECTION_GENERAL" value (must be unique)
#3) Now to track the stat just call the "scStatsCacheAddGeneral(enum, amt)" script and start tracking!
#3) If need be, to set a stat follow the last blue print below
#3) You are done, this stat will now be loaded and saved aotumatically!

---BLUEPRINT--- (CREATING THE STAT)
	case STATISTICS_TYPE.SECTION_GENERAL:
		switch (enu) {
			case STATISTICS_GENERAL.<STATISTIC>: val = "<UNIQUE VALUE>"; break;
			
---BLUEPRINT--- (TRACKING THE STAT)
	scStatsCacheAddGeneral(STATISTICS_GENERAL.<STATISTIC>, <AMOUNT>);
	
---BLUEPRINT--- (SET THE STAT)
	var stat = STATISTICS_GENERAL.<STATISTIC>; //This value can also be replaced for an array
	var amt = <AMOUNT TO SET>; //If above is an array, this must also be an array of values (can produce error if incorrect format)
	scStatsCache(STATISTICS_TYPE.VALUE_GENERAL, [stat], [amt]);
		
---Other Details---
- Stats will not be tracked if game is closed abruptly!
- Stats can be called and set and added to from anywhere!
